Robert Lucas,"I visited the Pizza Hut in New Lexington Ohio, the first indication that I should leave was there was no other people in the dining area. The pizza was absolutely terrible, the crust was like they threw the crust away and kept the cardboard. They're cutter wouldn't even cut through it. And when I told the waitress she said yes I know this. But didn't do anything about it. This used to be a really good place to eat but now its like everything else in this world it's a big rip off and it's garbage. I will never spend another penny at Pizza Hut. And I will tell everybody I can about my experience and hopefully they will boycott pizza hut also.|Useful|Share",11-Nov-23

customer,We booked a table for 7pm. Arrived on time. Ordered. Took until 8:10pm to bring the food. The restaurant was only half full. Shocking. No sense they cared.

Imran Akmal,"Been ordering from pizza hut for over 35 years, however will be no more. Service has become pathetic and substandard, they charge for delivery which takes even longer then it used to when it was free half the time they send deliveroo riders on bikes that take nearly an hour.

AMIT EATS,The taste is great and that is the reason why I go back to it. Every time you order you are given bonus slices but every time you try to re order and redeem the slices are not in your account. That is a complete con and a disgrace. Have previously contacted customer services but they are absolutely nightmare. Also ordered 4 pizza and the toppings are minimum and also there were slices which hardly had any toppings. Will change to another joint.|Useful|Share,19-Oct-23

CW,"Order never arrived despite ringing 3 times in a 2 and a half hour period. 3 hours later they ring to say they are ourside the door and they weren't even there, non stop phone calls to say they were outside and despite standing on the door step in the rain with no one there they argued they were. Unacceptable customer service from the branch who advised to log a complaint online, which is impossible without inside leg measurement! And then had the cheek to say 48 hours before a refund would be considered. The delivery driver who never arrived and argued they were at the right address (when they weren't) couldn't initiate a refund, why? Very poor customer service and won't be ordering or dining out here again. 3 decades of loyalty over other pizza options, and a massive disappointment that this couldn't have been dealt with easily.Shame as for a treat PH would be a go to option, despite living in a sleepy part of the UK it usually arrives cold and late, but normally we accept this but not any more, far too many bad experiences with the expectation they will do better never met.|Useful|Share",9-Nov-23

ZAVJLSJTS,"I’ve never done a trust pilot before but just thought I’d share my thoughts. I crave Pizza Hut stuffed crust a hand full of times a year. Every time I try to pay, it always says invalid payment method. Every single time I go to Dominos and put the same payment info in, it goes through. So every time I eat pizza, it’s from dominos. It’s just a regular card with the same information but Dominos always charges me and delivers to me, instead of Pizza Hut just rejecting my payment. I’m prob never ordering from Pizza Hut again since this problem occurs every time. Just thought I’d share. Wish you could take my hard earned money to eat your pizza, but I’ll stick with Dominos.|Useful|Share",2-Nov-23
Samantha short,We celebrated my daughters birthday and had around 25 children present for her party. Decided to treat them with pizza’s. Pizza Hut managed to get the large order to our address on time and the food itself was top quality. Enjoyed it so much that ordered again the following day and they did not disappoint.

Ella Waldron,"Unfortunately I have to give a bad review!! We ordered a 2 pizza deal for home delivery from pizza hut bath and it was a total farce. The order was very late so I had to ring several times and at one point the phone was put down on me!! When the pizzas finally arrived a full hour late they were hot but on closer inspection (after the driver had left, my bad) the order wasn't ours. It was meant for someone else and cost £4 less than the value of our order. We ordered a stuffed crust mac and cheese pizza and a chicken supreme and got a margarita pizza and a chicken and sweetcorn!! We were to hungry and frustrated to carry on with complaints and trying to rectify the situation as they clearly couldn't care less about customer service so eat the pizzas we were delivered but will not use again.... never ever!!|Useful|Share",26-Oct-23

When I have emailed them this and provided copies or the email order they still refuse to acknowledge the issue and just say they have no order on the system despite the email confirmation. Even when using the rewards, you have to still spend a minimum of £10 to have a delivery plus £2 delivery. So a free Pizza still cost £12. What and absolute joke. I will never use PizzaHut again.

Aki,"My local Pizza Hut (233 Eglinton Ave West, Toronto, Ontario) is cheating on Pizza toppings, I usually order SUPREME PIZZA as on Thursday it's their pizza of the day, the toppings on the supreme are pepperoni, seasoned pork, beef, mushrooms, green bell peppers, and onions. If you google Pizza Hut's supreme ingredients you will see this message ""What Is Pizza Hut's Supreme Pizza? Supreme Pizza is loaded with pepperoni, seasoned pork, beef, mushrooms, green bell peppers, and onions."" I started eating the pizza in the store where I ordered it and while I was eating I realized there was almost no pepperoni, usually the pepperonis cover the whole dough but on my pizza, they were placed only around the crust, and nothing in the middle or elsewhere and No MUSHROOM AT ALL. I was shocked I called one of the staff and showed him the ingredients of supreme pizza on Pizza Hut's website and said my pizza doesn't have any Mushrooms, he looked at the pizza and said yes and then suddenly showed me a very small flake of Mushroom and said "" there it is"" I said is that what you charged me for, we ( the customers) pay what Pizza Hut asks at least give us what we paid for. Suddenly a man with a black dirty shirt came next to the staff and kept pointing at the pizza and almost touching it, I asked him to please stop putting his finger in my pizza and he could not careless then I got angry and yelled at him (STOP IT) he got upset and started talking in his mother tongue to the other staff and left.I am 100% sure that the owner and management of this store told their cooks/employees to be stingy with the toppings to save money on food costs but they still keep raising the price. Pizza Hut has done this several times to me. This is unacceptable this is a false advertisement that needs to stop....pic of items is NOT what you receive. Why doesn't anyone regulate this issue?

Devon smith,"Went into Pizza Hit Norwich Riverside today and was greeted with a waitress that right off the bat was rude and disrespectful. When asked how many of us were dining there was 4 seated and two babies asleep in their pushchair but they refused to sit us at the 4 seater table as they stated that all pushchairs should be put to the front of the restaurants which is unreasonable as one is a newborn baby which I’m not going to sit and hold and eat over and the other a sleeping 20 month old whom I’m not going to wake to have a grumpy toddler! It’s complete discrimination against families yet Pizza Hut is meant to be a family restaurant?!There was space enough for a pram to be pulled up to the table (which we did in the end) and four sitting round no problem as we proved) you just didn’t want to serve us.Half the restaurant was empty for ‘reservations’ yet the whole time we were there only 2 tables were taken? So you would try to turn away paying customers to keep reserved tables free for hours before they’re clearly needed?Now here comes the real issue. To have a problem with a customer is one thing, yet to sit there moaning about us where other customers could hear.. and us! Is completely out of order. The waitress (blonde woman with pigtails) needs a serious talking too that this is unreasonable to expect to with put my babies at the front on the restaurant or just go somewhere else is why places like Pizza Hut are struggling in the day and age and especially to sit and talk behind our back about your customers where all can hear is why some waitresses clearly need re training in basic customer service skills.|Useful|Share",26-Aug-23

Lucy,"My son has food allergies and rather than make us feel welcome and at ease (which is how we have always felt with Pizza Hut in the past) the lady (which wasn’t her fault, she is doing what the company asks) said ‘we cannot guarantee that the food is 100% allergy free’. This is like teaching me to suck eggs. I know more than anyone how difficult it is to cater for an allergic child who could die if he ate the wrong thing. The only way to be truly ‘safe’ is to not go anywhere or eat in any restaurant. You could also say you can’t guarantee that the chef hasn’t picked his nose before preparing the meal, or washed his hands after going to the toilet. Well, can you guarantee this? No, you can’t. Sorry if this comes across hostile, but I am fed up with companies speaking this lazy rhetoric, basically shirking out of any responsibility they hold. I have had amazing experiences with other companies such as TGI Fridays who assure the customer that the manager will take control of the order and they have a very simple system of entering the allergens onto an iPad and it automatically shows what you can or cannot eat. I took much longer to order my meal than my friends because of the painstaking allergen menu process. Therefore we ate later than our friends who were on our table. Of course, there were no waiting staff because Pizza Hut have decided we can just scan a QR code. Who needs a waiter! I am very disappointed with a major company such as Pizza Hut, who should be leading the world of customer service. I always trusted Pizza Hut. Now I will never eat there again, because of the lazy and corner-cutting, money saving attitude they hold. One more thing, they describe allergies as a ‘lifestyle choice’ which is really upsetting to anyone who lives with food allergies. There is no choice involved in this. People with anaphylaxis can die if they eat the wrong foods. I would have thought a company as high profile as Pizza Hut would understand this more than anyone. Very disappointed.|Useful|Share",Updated 1 Oct 2023

Mr Jay Sedani,"Just got back from a family trip to Pizza Hut, midsummer boulevard in Milton Keynes. The visit was horrible. This is in stark contrast to my previous visit. Unlike the previous occasion when Liam made our time there pleasant and comfortable, this time we had a manager called ROB. Rob is a rude, unfriendly and unprofessional manager. I explained to him there were no working sanitizers and people were using the salad bar unclean. Everyone was trying the sanitiser stations with no success. There were no signs up. Rob’s response was “just use the toilets yeah”. How unprofessional! No apology, no attempt to explain. Just said that and walked off. Other customers were also shaking their heads.

In the end he said we’ll do that. Why argue with me. Why couldn’t you just say ok no problem. Jesus wept. Tue customer has paid nearly £30.

I called the store and talk to the manager and was told that when the register was closed out at the end of the night the second charge would be reversed.

When the order did eventually arrive the delivery driver pointed out his name and asked for a 5 star review! Even offered me a 500ml bottle of Pepsi. The quality of the pizza was so bad it was dripping everywhere. The base was soggy and under cooked. The tomato puree was dripping everywhere. The meat wasn't properly cooked and when I tried to call the manager, the so called manager started to threaten me! I asked for a refund but was refused despite the receipt being marked by the till as delayed. He told me to contact customer service but customer service was quoting social distancing as the reason for not answering the phone.

Friend was told there was no carmelised onion either and chose different topping.Air conditioning on full blast making restaurant cold and food went cold before we could finish eating as a result.

(Surely this should be done at closing) bill arrived charging us 20.99 each instead of 19.99. When queried we were told there had been a change to the deal and now only included classic sides which we hadn't been made aware of on ordering but had to choose another side as no garlic bread and classic option very limited.

And they expect you to tip for this? Pizza Hut, this is not servce - it's no better than being able to sit inside a takeaway and eat your food.

When we arrived the manager explained that they had ran out of stuffed crust for individual pizza and something else. We were still happy to order. Once seated and placed our order online it took the team 20 minutes to inform us the chicken pieces for starters were out of stock they did offer replacements but we weren't keen on the cheese balls or chicken wings. So the manager explained he would refund us for the starters which was fine by us. He apologised and we said its OK not his fault. Once the food arrived we asked a young girl if they had bbq sauce which she said yes just up there which we had to go get ourselves, but thought OK maybe just new.

Tony Burke,"I have always assumed overall costs to include delivery - & then buy to your budget. Your offers are not as good as they used to seem, & although written differently end up being the same - as if you think you are fooling the customer? All food seems to be getting dearer on the takeaway market, yet businesses are making more profit from the sheer volume. We decided that the typical takeaway meals we had been ordering were too expensive, so thought we'd try pizza for a change - although it's considered more of a heavy snack than a full meal. To be honest, the price was about the same after applying your best deals. And included in the deal was a desert. We chose Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough , with ice cream included. This is meant to be for 2. Fat chance? There was not enough dough, but I couldn't fit the spoon in the ice cream tub. When I rechecked the description - it stated small. It certainly didn't say minute or microscopic. I actually took a photo of it in comparison to a £2 coin. It doesn't give any better indication on your site as to the size. I felt proper mugged off. Who would buy that knowingly. A real disappointment. Is this what Pizza Hut now prides itself on? Not Happy. But after seeing the Trust Pilot ratings, & the fact that they do not appear to respond to issues, Maybe, it's my fault & shouldn't be surprised by the experience. I'm quite happy for Pizza Hut to address this with me.|Useful1|Share",17-May-23

Highlight,Pizza Hut in queensferry north wales are p i ss takers. I spent a lot of money two days before over £30 and the food wasn’t to bad but when I ordered through Uber eats the food turned up cold. I questioned the Uber eats driver and he said it’s hot. How does he know he didn’t put his hand on the food to check it and when I rung Pizza Hut in queensferry the female manager told me it was hot when it left the shop. Yeah it will be but not when the driver is delivering to other customers on his travels. Seriously Pizza Hut you even had the cheek to say it’s Ubers problem. Sorry to inform you and Uber are both equally to blame so to pass the buck which you did do Pizza Hut is disgraceful. It’s a case of you’ve had the money of me I can get lost now.

Was given allergy menu.Ordered food. Said 3 times that there’s a tomato allergy to my daughters plate. No sauce or tomato on her pizza. Plain base. She understood.Waited ages for food. Comes out, gives my daughter her pizza. They’ve seized bbq sauce over her pizza?! BBQ has tomato in! They’ve just given an allergen to a child with an allergy!!! I’ve explained she can’t have it for that reason. She takes it back and says it’ll be another 10/15 mins to re cook!!!My daughter is autistic, she didn’t understand why we’ve all got our food and her not…When food finally came out 15-17 mins later, she didn’t want it, she was put off from earlier and wasn’t hungry by that point:…They also forgot our side order of chips….They came out once we finished our meal!Spoke to the manager, who apologised and said he’s not really sure what to say. He’s told the chef off, my daughters meal is free! She didn’t eat!!He says the chest read the order wrong and got confused!!That’s when I got more annoyed and said , what they’ve done is an allergy breach. You’ve placed a known allergen infront of a child with that allergy, their lucky nothing serious happened, where she ate it…Plus the side order was forgotten!He then offers 2kids meals free, and s pudding…. Hardly makes up for it really.The waitress then never came back to our table. Our food/plates were left in front of us. We had to go and case someone to actually pay.The table next to us wasn’t cleared for vet an hour!!!Very attentive staff!!!Extremely disappointed in the lack understanding of an allergy!And overall service.Oh and my husbands pizza had 3 peppers randomly in his pizza, again had this of been something anyone was allergic to, huge problem! Chef’s really need to be aware of what they are doing and putting in food!!!I won’t even mention the fact I’m disabled and the toilet was wet/slippery with the mop bucket and cones in the way!

Ordered a chicken sizzler for him and never noticed until I checked how long and my email for this that the order had gone through as a meaty one. I sent it back and asked the delivery driver to tell them it was the wrong order. He told me to phone the shop being North Lane Headingley the guy who answered initially was ignorant I asked him to send what I thought I had originally ordered and he just hung up. 45 mins later I phoned them to find out where this pizza was to be put onto the phone to a guy who called himself Murphy that I had sent the pizza back I explained to him this wasn't the first time that pizza hut website had ordered a completely different pizza he told me to phone customer service. I asked him if I could call round to collect and was told no. This morning I did call customer service to hear a message saying since COVID they no longer have a manned line and to contact the store you ordered from.

I looked and apparently they had taken the money out and put it back in. Odd but okay. Decided to try again cause I thought it was a glitch in the system. Declined again. I was getting mad. Checked my bank account again and the money was gone. Leaving me with one dollar. This time it said it had gone through but I had no confirmation. Called the restaurant in a panic but the person who answered sounded extremely uninterested in what was happening. He didn’t even answer me back for a good minute. Finally got a response that was basically “too bad not my problem” and hung up. At this point I was in a complete panic cause I thought I had lost all the money I was using for this pizza.

Andre,"Trip to Pizza Hut and oh my what a mistake. Book a table… stand at the door for 15 minutes being ignored by the clueless staff before being shown to my table! (Restaurant only 1/3 full)Floors are grimey, food and rubbish all over it. They no longer let you order with a person, only online via QR code. Oh and blue light discount doesn’t apply on any ‘deals’ so unless you’re just ordering a pizza without anything else you’re fine!Get drinks and salad. No bowls so had to wait for them to get us some. Sit down with said salad. Have to ask for knives and forks, because they haven’t set the table. Not delivered. Ask again… Guy huffs and goes and gets them. Don’t even ask about the state of the salad bar area… revolting! Although by this point they’ve already made you pay online!Pizza took nearly 45 minutes to be cooked and they’re so tight with the size and toppings! Plus it sat on the side for 5 minutes going cold! (That’s mine in the photo but they wouldn’t let me take it from there) Gone are the days of PH being a place to eat. My recommendation, get a Domino's Pizza and stay at home! 🍕|Useful|Share",15-Mar-23
Bhavna,Today I wanted to go back and do what I loved looking forward to in my young days. So I went along to pizza hut. After 8 years plus I wanted to taste that yummy potato salad and coleslaw the deep pan pizza and delicious garlic bread. How disappointed was I. The salad had no taste. Bread didn't taste garlicky. And the pizza spicy veg hot one now has extra cheese ....why??? I asked for extra pineapple but couldn't taste much pineapple at all. be generous with the extras I am paying for it. Overall I was disappointed. Why do you change the original brilliant recipe's. Can you please go back to the old original recepis.  Bring the original pizzas and garlic bread that actually taste like garlic bread. And sane with the salad.Thank you|Useful|Share,15-Mar-23

Lisa Von Trappengard,"Oh honey, let me tell you about my recent experience at Pizza Hut as an 80-year-old grandma. I walked in and was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the restaurant. You know, some places just can't seem to get the memo that customers don't want to eat in filth.But enough about that, let's talk about the pizza. I ordered the pepperoni and let me tell you, it was everything I could have hoped for and more. The crust was crispy and had just the right amount of chewiness, the sauce was flavorful without being overpowering, and the toppings were plentiful.But what really stood out to me was the customer service. The staff was attentive and went out of their way to make sure I had a great experience. They even helped me carry my pizza out to the car. Now that's what I call service!Overall, I would highly recommend Pizza Hut to anyone looking for a great meal and outstanding customer service.

But a very rude man approached us and without any asking or even greeting “Hello, what can I do for you? Would you like to eat in our restaurant etc..”, just said that toilets are closed and for customers! So how did he know we are not customers?

Sarah,"I was excited to see that Pizza Hut near me had started offering gluten free, vegan pizzas. I am not vegan, but cannot have lactose so often have to opt for vegan cheese. I was unable to add meat alongside vegan cheese, which was inconvenient but I decided I'd be happy with a veggie pizza. The photos on the website showed a round pizza, looking pretty delicious as you'd expect. When I got the pizza it was a very sad attempt at pizza... I'd say it was more a dry cracker and it was a rectangle shape. There was hardly any cheese on so the base had gone like cardboard. For over £18 it was just an absolute joke (especially considering the non GF one was 8.99 for a large). I will stick to making my own pizzas at home with schar bases (which are lovely and far from dry).|Useful1|Share",19-Feb-23

Phil,Some years ago Pizza Hut came out with the big New Yorker and that was the only Pizza I liked from there. I find their pizza too greasy not enough toppings or sauce just not my style. I did enjoy the big New Yorker so when the announcement came out that it was returning I was happy to try it again. I ordered one tonight the worst pizza I've had in years. Nothing like the original big New Yorker looked nothing like it tasted nothing like it. I do not know what they sprinkled on it but it literally was like biting into a salt packet with cheese and sauce on it. I came home and I've got some stray cats and dogs in my area I literally sat the pizza out for them. I am truly disappointed because that was the one pizza years ago that they did right. I think they let a lot of people down that don't really do Pizza Hut often and we're excited about the return of the big new yorker. Hopefully someone higher up sees this and maybe they can correct the issue.|Useful|Share,19-Feb-23

My husband called the location hoping someone would come to the front and see us but the phone rang and rang without any answer. We stood for a moment longer discussing where else we should go and eat, hoping someone would seat us and acknowledge we were there but nothing. It was really odd.

Craig Herring,"Cannot believe that in times of high inflation and with some people struggling to have spare cash to treat themselves to treats like Pizza Hut, this restaurant chain takes the decision to increase its value range (Hut Saver Menu) to £8.99 per pizza. Last year the pizzas on the value range were only £5 per pizza. That’s an increase of 80%, plus they also now charge £1.50 for delivery which never used to exist.Shame on you Pizza Hut for ripping people off when they are hard up for cash. These price increases do not fall in line with the current rate of inflation which means that you are just looking to make maximum profit at every opportunity you have.Last year I used to be able to buy 3 pizzas in the Hut Saver Menu for £5 each totalling £15. Now you want £8.99 per pizza totalling £26.97 plus £1.50 delivery which now totals £28.47 and that is a 90% price increase.A 90% PRICE INCREASE IS AN ABSOLUTE JOKE.

Went the above restaurant tonight with my boyfriend to get an table for till on arrival seen this male called Dan who an manager told me to come back in approx 30 mins  also asked if I can booked an table online he said yes !When back just after 20.00 pm to get a table for two the same person in question said give us a couple of mins while it get cleaned of course I said thanks u . I didn’t expect next what happened next So got to seats and then looked at menus I ordered using the app and placed an order for 3 sides and two drinks and one large pizza witch totally £47.16 over all . At this order went in approx 5 mins later on I went up and spoken to male again who called Dan asked for glass who replied rather than say here u go you’re have to wait until they came to the table !! I found his attitude extremely poor and shocking in how he came across to me and didn’t mean an reference back to him They then came to table no thanks from server from this point until I asked a member of staff when they were serving an larvae party who came in no one came to table or explained there’s long delays etc with food . When I stopped a member of staff I asked her how long food will be what we ordered and the email address from Pizza Hut has the service was outrageous and poor . Even when I asked where the food the person came back still being made I asked the same member of staff again for Pizza Hut email address and at this point then manager came over he’s called Dan restaurant manager also !!!His attitude the experience didn’t help I asked email for emails rather than get it me he told me to Google it and didn’t want to find it until I said I email the ceo for Pizza Hut !! I explained the service was extremely poor and experience too he didn’t seem to care when I said I would email customer care he just simple no problems or that’s fine I asked him for area manager information he wouldn’t provide this to me but then said before I decided to walk out and cancel my order because his experience and outrageous help and service I will inform area manager and customer care of which I found worrying in fact I would say he’s already trying to cover his own back Has my food was about to come to table I got up with my boyfriend and cancel my order I told this manager called Dan the reason for leaving his you the way he treated me and helped and acted outrageous and shocking I would question if he seems to have problems me with my boyfriend too ?I am extremely shocked and upset and this made me walk out also my partner need food because of his health and couldn’t wait any longer.I am visiting up here and live in Manchester and I have never experienced such extreme poor and shocking behaviour which made me walk out in this way !!!!!!!Someone needs to contract me urgently about this I ended up having to go kfc instead of what I didn’t want too|Useful|Share,27-Jan-23

Virginia Smith,"This post is unusual for me. I always make an effort to find something positive to say about a business, regardless of any issues. This Pizza Hut, in Ellisville, Mississippi will be the exception.  I wish I could give a -3 rating. On 1/31/2023, I decided to pick up a personal pan pizza near my home after driving 8 hours from Atlanta. I stopped in Laurel around 6:15 PM and called the order in. I arrived at the restaurant by about 6:30 PM. I waited about 10 minutes to get to the window to pay. I paid cash. I was told to pull forward and they would bring the pizza to me. I waited and waited, until about 7:10 PM. I went into the store to find out what the problem was. I approached the counter. I tried to get the attention of an older woman who seemed to be the one in charge. She asked me what I needed, and I told her in a normal voice that I had been waiting for a long time for my pizza. She said she did not hear me, so I repeated my issue again in a normal voice. She again said she could not hear me. So, I raised my voice. She then told me that I did not need to yell and that I needed to be respectful. She did not indicate to me that she was going to give me her full attention, and proceeded to continue arguing with me that I was being disrespectful. Now I'm mad. One of the workers came around the corner with my pizza. I was told it was her first day. Fine. I asked if I could get a refund. The older lady said no - that she would give me a credit. This lady continued arguing with me and never indicated to me that she was going to make the situation right. A man at the counter tried to give me $7, as if the money was the problem. I told him I did not need or want his money, that I wanted them to take responsibility for keeping me waiting for so long. The lady still did not stop what she was doing to try to issue a refund. So, I just left. With this business, when they mess up and should make it right, they antagonize and argue endlessly and when the customer gets angry, they blame the customer for getting mad and do nothing to make the situation right. I will never go back to this business. There is nothing that they can do now to assure me that they will not antagonize me, then make me look like the Karen when they are the ones that messed up and would not do anything to make the situation right.|Useful|Share",22-Jan-23

Calum,"Pizza Hut Dundee, terrible would be putting it mildly. Ignored upon arrival and finally shown to our table by a manager who couldn’t be less interested if he tried. He didn’t even make eye contact once. The process now is thar you order from your phone (which I think is impersonal, non inclusive when you consider people who don’t/can’t use a phone etc). We waited a long time for our order only for the wrong things to come out. Again, staff uninterested, blatantly ignoring customers and not helpful. The salad bar used to be amazing- now the same things are repeated round the bar, very limited choice. As customers were filling their bowls, staff were pushing in to replenish the stock without as much as an “excuse me” or waiting a moment for the customer to finish. Awful. Food was ok, nothing amazing. Not great in comparison to how it once  was. The Pepsi was watery and the ice cream machine was broken, of course they didn’t advise this when we sat down and both kids expecting ice cream.The prices are high for Pizza Hut but sadly the service and product no longer is reflective of what you pay for. On the whole, the experience was truly awful. Sad to see Pizza Hut deteriorate to this. Sadly feel unless they change soon, this place is headed for administration.

Then to top it off the next night 15-1-23 @7,15pm  another order arrived with the same items we ordered the night before and we told driver it was not ours and he could take it back will not use this company again i appreciate mistakes happen but the service we received trying to resolve the issue was shocking we put a complaint in and was told we couldn’t have a refund at no point did we ask for a refund|Useful|Share",6-Jan-23

Susan Dickey,"Ordered pizza online (Saturday Jan. 7th), picked up, paid, and tipped. Got home pizza was made incorrect, sandwich was not made correct. Called store (Pizza Hut, 7345 Lakeshore, Mentor Ohio) talked to Manager Theo.. “said it’s a pizza” nothing he could do. Gave me a bogus phone number for district manager. Called back Theo at location wouldn’t come to phone and told employee to hang up. Waited till Monday, called back.. got Theo again… it's just a pizza lady, said don’t order from us anymore. But I feel there should be customer service done correctly for over a $30 order. If this is how they handle their error and pretty much say “to bad, it’s just a pizza” eventually they will put themselves out of business. ☹️|Useful|Share",29-Dec-22

Benn,"Another poor experience it seems. We went to the site adjacent to the cinema in Crawley, West Sussex.My email to them complains is as follows!I'm afraid nothing about our experience was in anyway satisfactory. We visited after a cinema trip with another family, we had two children between us.Upon arrival we waited for more than 10 minutes to be acknowledged by staff, which didn't happen. We bypassed other queuing customers to ask a member of staff whether someone was able to greet and seat us. They obliged but this took another 10 minutes, with free tables clearly visible.The table we were taken to was still dirty when we were guided to it, and we spent more time lingering by the table for this to be sorted. Ridiculous when a few tables over there was a perfectly good table. It seems that the staff, Limited though they may have been, were herding customers to ""given"" tables.Once we were seated, we were given menus but no indication as to how to order other than to scan the QR code. This did not work as we logically assumed that the QR code in the menu was the one to scan, not the on the table. Only once we managed to collar another member of staff and spent several minutes looking at phones did they indicate how and why we could not select the necessary items online!We then endured the fiasco of three individial orders being made online for our group, which was entirely cumbersome. This also meant out meals arrived in three batches, one of which was wrong for the children and meant we had to passify them by sharing pizza - not so simple when one of them isn't able to eat dairy.The food was equally bad. Stodgy, really greasy pizza bases where the oils have soaked through etc. The best part was the chicken nuggets and orange juice.No staff asked us whether we would like condiments or even instructed with regards the salad buffet arrangement.Whilst waiting we watched numerous people arrive and wait in vain, while customers and ourselves just looked onto the obysmal state of the surrounding tables.Had we the option to order and pay post meal, I would have only made payment by protest. Even the children didn't eat their food properly, citing it was too floppy or squidgy.We will not be returning.|Useful|Share",18-Dec-22

Tonya S.,"My incident happened on November 20, 2022 at the Prosperity Park Drive location – Store # 35593.After placing an online order for contactless, curbside pick-up, I arrived to pick up my order as scheduled and checked in using the Pizza Hut app.    Upon arriving, this location had a continuous flow of customer activity; nevertheless, I patiently waited in my car for my order.   After approximately 15 minutes upon arrival, I decided to call the number to the location to notify the employee I was waiting.    I was on hold for approximately 30 minutes, but I still waited because I could see the location was indeed busy.   Thinking, during a break of customer activity, the employee would then deliver my order.   This did not happen.    Although no one was in the store at the time, she had the audacity to motion for me to come in the store.   I felt this was inappropriate since I had scheduled contactless, curbside service and paid a gratuity in advance.As soon as I reached the door, the employee yelled at me to say, ‘I’m by myself and you see I am busy’.   I stated to her, I have been waiting outside for 30 minutes and that’s not my concern.   She then used profane language at me and told me my order was cancelled.   She continued to hurl profanity as she walked to the back of the store.    I said if you cancel my order, that’s fine, I have paid for my order so process my refund.   She then stated, “I’m not going to process anything, and you can just get out of the store”.   I asked for her name so I could report the incident and she refused and told me to leave the store.   To say I was shocked, is an understatement.   With her deranged type of behavior, I feared she may resort to physical violence so I abruptly left the store.I have reached out to the following Executives in Leadership and to this day, NO ONE has followed up with me.   I have contacted:  Aaron Powell, CEO, David Graves, President, Jamie Harrison, CPO and Chequan Lewis, COO.While I did speak with Shelli East, DM, she did not follow up with me right way after the incident.   When I asked for Senior Leadership to contact me about the incident, I have heard nothing.If the leaders are acting this way, I see why the employee felt she could get away with what she did in this situation.With such a recognized organization, this has been a horrible experience and I will never shop at Pizza Hut again.|Useful|Share",13-Dec-22

The person taking our order knew that very well and assured us that we will receive our food. We waited patiently for an HOUR and our food didn't arrive. Nobody even informed us that our order was canceled. This is preposterous. This horrible service should not be applied to others as nobody deserves such horrible service. Instead of hiring high school dropouts why don't you hire some people with experience and actually know how to their job. We are disgusted with your service. Don't be surprised why domino's out did you by an astronomical amount. Why don't you guys take time and put in some passion and love when comes to serving customers.

Rachel,Went for lunch with my mum on Friday 25th November at pizza hut Colchester Turner Rise.We were told to order from the QR code on table for the buffet which asks for a tip when paying up front? How can you leave a tip with no service or before eating ?      We paid and headed to the salad bar. It looked wanting limp lettuce and soggy cucumber was very disapointing but thought ok the pizza will be better. The pizzas were few and far between only one pizza was brought out at any one time with half a resturant full of diners and the fact that pizza hut have offered this option for many years i would of thought it would of been better organised. So we waited and waited for a vegatarian option to come out . My mum was getting hungry so opted for some salad till it arrived approx 8 mins later .We only had 3 small slices each of pizza as couldnt wait any longer. Later that evening my mum calls me ...she had been so sick vomiting and diahorrea she hadnt had anything else to eat that day other than at this resutrant. Lucilky I myself was fine so we thought about what we ate differently and came to the conclusion the salad bar or its was from the mayonaise / french dressing which i did not eat which must have been the cause.This is not the first time a family memeber has been vomitting after eating at this restuarnt. 3 years ago my daughter also suffered vomitting after eating at the ice cream station ! I didnt complain at the time as being a kid thought it was maybe a coincidence but now a second family member has been ill after eating here . It's safe to say we will not be returning or recommending!I have already made a complaint directly to pizza hut but the response I recieved from their customer care department  regarding their daily safety checks was woolly stating that tempreture checks had been made throughout the day and all where within the correct tempreture.

Sarena,"If 0 was a rating then Pizza Hut would be -50. I visited my local restaurant on Saturday after a day out, my god, I wish I didn’t.When I arrived the person serving on the takeaway reception failed to even acknowledge me TWICE as they were too busy gossiping in front of the other customers, so I had to order online.After 35 minutes of waiting in the reception, I finally got my pizza and ventured home. When I did get home the pizza looked burnt but my husband, kids and I were so hungry we TRIED to eat it, I say tried because it was extremely hard to even bite through the pizza. It was so burnt, it ended up being chewy! I called the restaurant 3 times on Saturday night to try and rectify the issue by either getting a new pizza or a refund - no one answered even though there were a lot of staff working that night. After one bite, the pizza took a trip to the bin. Then, I made the horrid mistake of thinking that customer service would be able to process a refund and put my complaint forward to the restaurant for improvement - how wrong I was.  Reply times were good that’s the only positive, however, my complaint was completely and utterly ignored. I was forced to take a voucher that I didn’t want in replace of a refund. Baring in mind this is my second bad experience now with my local restaurant, the first time the pizza was bad but I put it down to being just a one off but now I know this wasn’t the case and Pizza Hut has just gone down hill considerably. Looking at the reviews from other customers, I can see many have the same view of Pizza Hut. It’s utterly rubbish and a waste of money!

customer,"I love Pizza Hut, and I have been a customer for many years. However, the customer service at the Hall Rd location in Macomb, Michigan is horrible. I placed an online order for the wrong time. I immediately called in to get the pickup time changed but they kept picking the phone up and hanging up. The third time I called they held the phone for a little over a minute, never said anything to me, and I could hear them arguing with a customer about a coupon or something. I guess they realized I was on the phone so they hung up again. I called back a fourth time and finally got an answer. The girl that answered was extremely rude when I asked her to change my order time. She was acting as if she couldn’t comprehend what I was asking her and got extremely nasty, as if I was asking for too much. I asked her to just cancel my order and her name. Her attitude was horrible. I really wanted my pizza, but at that point I was afraid they would do something to it. Her behavior was disgusting. I called back to make a complaint but the manager basically told me to call 1-800- Pizza Hut. When I called the number provided online to make the complaint the next day, I was directed to call the restaurant in which I was complaining back. Unacceptable behavior!!!

There were only like 10 tables occupied and the rest of the hut empty. I asked him u close at 2230 and u are refusing us a table. This is pathetic. The kids were really upset and my daughter was almost about to cry. This is not on. I then contacted via the form on their website and asked this to be escalated and I was told someone will get back to me. After a week of no contact I sent another email and a few hours later some guy called Steve said I tried to reach u but was unable to do so.

Thomas Vince,DEBIT CARD FRAUD BY ASSOCIATE AND UNPROTECTED CC MACHINES!!!The Pizza Huts on N. Nevada and N. Division (Spokane Washington) have credit card machines that are wide open and are not shielded to prevent counter associates from seeing you entering your your pin number on debit cards.The first time it happened I figured it was a coincidence and I had no real proof that that the counter associate stole anything from me at the N. Nevada location in Spokane WA. charged over 300 dollars after charging a very small amount first. Now the coincidence has just happened again just one day after using my debit card again this time at the N. Division location. It was my only debit card purchase. The next day a very small amount was charged to my account. You see I have been checking my account daily after the first theft and I caught immediately and froze my card. The ONLY person who had access to my pin number and cc number was THE ASSOCIATE AT THE PIZZA HUT!!!!!! The credit machines are not secure! I will NEVER use my cards at a pizza hut AGAIN!

B C,"I don't order pizza very often, because I don't eat cheese. I love a pizza with sausage and black olives and pineapple, and extra tomato sauce to hold everything on....but it's such a hassle trying to get it made correctly, without cheese. So I've only gone to the Pizza Hut in Batesville, AR, once before, and they actually made it right, no cheese. So I thought I'd try again. Big mistake. I ordered 4 pizzas so me and my kids could watch a movie and enjoy a pizza. They get the movie ready, I make the 30 minute round trip to Pizza Hut and back to the house. Everybody's starving, of course. But they screwed mine up and put cheese on it. Pause the movie, make the call. They want me to bring the wrong pizza back. Odd, but OK, maybe they just want to see it to see that I'm not lying....But no, they made me drive another 30 minute round trip to just do an exchange. Any manager worth 3/4 of a damn would have apologized, told me to keep the wrong one, duh, and come get the correct pizza.. Unbvelievable. So I told them to just give me a refund, and I went to Burger King. Now I'm even hungrier and more irritated, and I'm waiting another 20 minutes at BK, but they were cool and threw in some coupons to apologize for the long wait in their drive through...So, yeah, Pizza Hut never gets another dime from me, ever.

Xxxxxxxx,"On arriving at the Pizza Hut, we were faced with no option but to scan the QR code & order via the app. This is not only discriminatory but a concern regarding a potential breach of GDPR and is open to fraud.

Secondly, I would like to know why you feel it is not necessary to offer an option of payment methods & force customers to use an app, which could go against their financial security practices.My next issue is that we had to ask 3 times for glasses and then had to collect them ourselves, a majority of the pizza was cold,the salad bar was not replenished and the cutlery was blunt and dirty. Additionally, the only non diet bottomless drink you offer is Fanta, which again is discriminatory, as the sweatener replacements in the diet drinks have many known health concerns & are not compatible with a variety of health conditions.

obi,"I've had to give one star, I'd rather give none! First and last time I've ordered from my local outlet and the only saving grace was the chirpy delivery guy who even politely laughed at my stupid jokes!The only other almost saving grace was that the food arrived nice and hot but everything else, from first impression to last bite, was underwhelming to say the least.Firstly, portion size: Being someone built slightly larger than the average person, the side of potatoes wedges I received seemed to have been produced from baby spuds as opposed to regular sized ones! The portion didn't even come close to filling the box. Even the pizzas themselves were more of what one would expect to receive if one had ordered a medium. I ordered large.Secondly, the food: In a word; disgusting! Both in looks and taste. Pizzas I've purchased from other outlets have mostly been appealing, vibrant and with a distinction between topping ingredients allowing me to identify what I was actually putting into my mouth. The barely recognisable food items I got would have been more at home at the eruption of mount Vesuvius. Overcooked bacon that I could have shaved with, small nodules of Italian style sausage which resembled squirrel droppings and those were the ingredients I could identify.I only managed to choke down around half the pizza before my gag reflex put its foot down and told me ""no more"". Bland, overcooked, poorly presented, disgusting.Without a shadow of a doubt, I will never again order from pizza hut, even should my life depend upon it, on the off chance that I will once more receive food  - and I use that term in its loosest possible sense - the outlet that produced my order.Kudos to my delivery guy though.|Useful|Share",Updated 14 Jun 2022

However, I am sad to report that after the last seven or eight weeks of constant screwups, unparalleled incompetence, and a website that crashes every few minutes during peak times, we are so long for good.

And after waiting from five to thirty minutes at a time for the call center to finally answer a call and being treated like an enemy, we have decided to simply go to Costco from now on and buy our weekly pizzas and do the baking ourselves rather than waste another five or six hours and many dollars on what used to be the best deal in town. By the way. Last Friday evening I placed a call to the call center at 8:30 PM. I finally hung up the phone at 10:15 PM after waiting for an answer for an hour and 45 mins. Don’t get me wrong. Pizza Hut still makes the best pizza for the money; on the very rare occasion when they manage to get it right. It’s just that they never seem to get it right anymore and the manager I spoke with today about the most recent screw-up made it very clear that he didn’t really give a poo. He suggested that the next time I order through the call center I should double-check to make sure they get the order right as if their screw-up was my fault. I was also charged $21 for one $10 Tastemakers' Pizza. He didn’t even offer to replace the pizza they had just screwed up at the North Main Street store. Well, like they used to do at Pizza Hut, I’m DONE. It’s very sad to see what was once the best in town become the worst I have ever had to deal with. Goodbye, Pizza Hut. Don’t call me and I sure as heck ain't calling you!|Useful|Share",Updated 17 May 2022

Visited the restaurant 14th April and used the online app to order and pay as requested, didn’t realise until a few days later my card was charged twice, phoned the store and was told there policy was to direct all complaints to there customer services online, what a joke that is, several emails to and from containing attachments of back statements and order conformation and 3-4 weeks later still not received my refund, called the store to say customer services don’t seem to be sorting the problem and requested number for head office……. Not allowed to give it out! Have to complain via the website so then I request a call back from store manager ( on 2 separate occasions ) still as yet to speak to a manager just had a colleague call me back saying there policy is to complain through the website “only staff are allowed to speak to head office” I strongly advise anybody that has ever used the online order service to order/ pay for either take away or dine in to carefully check their statements, how many others have been a victim and are unaware, I only noticed by chance, finally check out the reviews for there head office with regards to customer services it has to be one of the worst I’ve seen for a company!!!!!|Useful|Share",29-Apr-22

Sophie,"Pizza Hut used to be our go-to pizza delivery. My fiancé is coeliac so it was always a perfect option as we could always rely on gluten free options being available. Recently they had stock issues of the gluten free bases, which we completely understand...however we did notice that the gluten free bases were still available through Deliveroo and Uber Eats, and it actually came as we ordered it! Recently again, Pizza Hut have come out to say that gluten free is back (even though it was still technically available), only now it is only available for Collection directly from Pizza Hut, or through one of their delivery partners, i.e Deliveroo, Uber Eats, etc. BUT when you try ordering for delivery directly from Pizza Hut, gluten free pizzas aren't available. How does this make any sense? It is more expense to order through one of their delivery partners than it is to order direct from them, so yet again as a coeliac in today's day, my fiancé is left feeling wanting and honestly neglected by big businesses such as Pizza Hut. Why is it fair that people with legitimate gluten intolerances have to pay more to get their food delivered? This is made even worse by the fact that the deals that Pizza Hut offer don't include gluten free on their website, where these options used to be available before the pandemic. We'd love for this to get looked into as it's really not fair at all.|Useful|Share",27-Apr-22

We were seated quite quickly but not told about any delays on food orders or that I had to use the qr code to order. Order placed at 1923. Got our drinks approx 10 mins later but the salad bar was literally empty. Waited another 10 mins for it to be only 1/3 filled. At 2003 I asked the server how long it might be as we had cinema booked. She went to check and said about another 10-15 minutes. I asked her again at 2023. She said we were the next order to go in. I told her to just box the pizza up as we couldn’t eat on the restaurant and had to get to our movie. She apologised but was so rushed off her feet I don’t think it was overly sincere. I don’t believe so many people should be seated if it’s taking over an hour to cook a pizza.

Alan Wright,"The decline of what use to be a great experience. I now realise why so many have closed. This review is about the Hayes restaurant. Regular users will know that the menu and ordering process is now done on line so takes a lot longer to give them your order having to navigate their menu and as a last resort ask one of the staff to help. There were plenty of staff on duty so why they can't just take your order like anywhere else, perhaps they think they are modern and forward thinking or just lazy? So we finally placed our mains order and be for you pay it asks if you would like to add any gratuity which is a joke as they haven't lifted a finger yet and the service as in this case might be crap.While waiting for our meal a couple of our party had the need to use the bathroom and as with most businesses that serve the public they had an inspection chart on the wall where staff inspect the bathroom at regular intervals to make sure they are hygienic and up to standard. So while we were in the bathroom one of the staff came in and went straight to the chart, logged the time and added their initials and went straight back out so there could have been any number of problems in there and they wouldn't have a clue. Anyway our food arrived and to be fair it was good as it usually is so why can't the service be the same.So back onto the experience and we had finished our main course and started to look online at the dessert menu and we placed our order after neatly stacking all our mains plates etc to help the staff and at the same time give them something to do.Our main course left overs, plates and utensils remained on the table all packed up ready to go with staff regularly passing by not daring to earn any gratuities. Our desserts arrived and were placed where there was space as much of the space was still taken by our main course stuff. So to quickly get to the end of this saga we ate our dessert with all of the mains rubbish still on the table and for this they charged us over £100 for the pleasure.Not sure I would bother again and certainly wouldn't use the Hayes restaurant.|Useful|Share",21-Feb-22

I waited for another 10 minutes, nobody called. But, I received the email asking for feedback. Then I called the shop again but the man doesn’t seem happy to answer my call. I said I didn’t receive any call but he replied as ‘WE CAN’T CALL EVERY CUSTOMER’. I asked how I will know when the delivery came if I don’t receive any call. He said another 30 minutes and cut the call. I waited for another 1 hour. Nobody came and nobody called. I tried to call the shop about 4 times but nobody received the call.

Teri Lockwood,"I stopped in at the Pizza Hut in Brownfield, TX to order a salad and wings. The menu showed a Caesar salad and a variety of wings. I ordered the chicken Caesar salad and 8 boneless wings. After 30 MINUTES I received my Caesar salad with no Caesar dressing and almost warm chicken wings. I asked for Caesar dressing and all I was told is “we just have Ranch.” All this with attitude. Five people standing around doing NOTHING!!!! So that tells me someone could have gone to the grocery store and bought some damn Caesar salad dressing. I guess what really got the attitude going was when I asked for another Ranch dressing because somehow one tiny cup was enough for the salad and the wings. Service was horrible. The employees were horrible. The wait time was horrible. For all this I most certainly would fire the manager. That is where the excellent service starts. This Pizza Hut gets no star review. I will never eat there again and I will not recommend this particular Pizza Hut to anyone.|Useful|Share",31-Jan-22

Arrived waited almost 10mins for someone to acknowledge me only to be advised order received but not sent through to the kitchen, did I want a free dessert.  I declined as would have ordered a dessert if I wanted one.  Was told would be max 7 mins & assured food would be cooked properly & hot. Came 10-12 mins later.

CM,"Ordered pizzas and other items that never came. During the order I asked for a ""no contact"" delivery. The driver decided to try to call me on my phone which requires that the caller say their name and what they are calling about BEFORE ringing my phone. The driver did not bother, hung up, and went back to the store. Nobody tried after that to deliver the $75+ order or let me know that they were not going to deliver it. Then, when I called to ask why it wasn't there after more than 2 hours they would not let me talk to their manager. I later drove to the store location and found the manager's information posted in that location was from a manager that hadn't overseen that location for more than 2 years he said when I called him. The actual manager did not post his information. Total garbage for a company. Not the first time they have done things like this, but this was the last time we'll order from them.Update: This was at the North Liberty, IA location and this isn't the first time they've failed to complete an order. It will be the last time we try getting food from there though.|Useful|Share",26-Jan-22

I've ordered tons, tipped well, and this location just told me to pick up or go to hell.

Kerry Malter,"I had ordered an extra pepperoni thin crust pizza for a little over 15 dollars from the 7310 Airline Hwy Baton Rouge location. Unfortunately there was not extra pepperoni on the pizza, spaces in between the pepperoni plus the crust seemed over cooked. It looked like a plain pepperoni pizza with brittle crust. I called to give feedback.  The first phone call was answered after 4 rings then put on hold before the phone was quickly disconnected. I called back to someone stating she was not sure what to do because she was new. I asked if she could take a message to give it to someone who could help then another person picked up quickly and stated that I received less pepperoni after requesting for extra, you do not receive extra when you requesr it and there were no spaces in between the peperoni slices. When I said there were plenty of space between the slices, she continued to argue her point so I stated I would contact corporates and hung up. My husband stated they seemed very busy with three employees. I am more disappointed with the customer service provided over the phone than my order that was not prepaired for what I paid.

Sam Rand,"I placed an order that took 1 hour and 51 minutes to get delivered. Now I live just 1 block away. I was using their app to track the order both on my laptop and my phone because after 1 hour 30 minutes it continued to show they hadn't even made it yet. So I call and the lady that answers seemed uninterested, so I insisted she verify where my order was. She gets back on the phone says it was ready and would be delivered soon. It finally arrived at 1 hour and 51 minutes from the time I placed my order and it arrived completely COLD. So I called them back. I spoke with 2 people this time and they could care less that I waited almost 2 hours and received a cold pizza, not even warm but cold.  I expected them to replace the pizza and do it quickly this time or refund my money. I ordered and paid for a hot pizza and I expected a hot pizza. They took my money but didn't deliver on what I paid for. Finally, she tells me she could only give me a credit for the next time I order pizza. After this experience and poor customer service why would I ever want to order from them again so in frustration I told her to keep her credit because I will not be ordering from them again. The staff truly does not care about their customers at all and their service is the worst.

My order was confirmed, yet a LONG time had passed and I’m wondering where my food is…. So I call. I speak to someone that says she’s the manager, I believe her name was Alexis or something. I’m like “where’s my food” (in a much more pleasant way ofc) and she tells me that I entered it wrong blah blah blah and it would take another 45!!! Mins to get to me. AT LEAST!!!  But if I want to pick it up she’ll remake it and I can get it in 10-15. Cool. Oh, I forgot to mention I had already included an over $7 tip for the delivery driver. So I show up to pick up my food and do you think she refunded my DELIVERY DRIVER PAYMENT????   Uh, no. Even after I mentioned it to her. THEN she screwed up and admitted I didn’t get my order delivered because they didn’t have enough drivers!!!!  And yet she keeps the DELIVERY FEE AND TIP!!!!!   Big NO on ever going there again.

I have then had to chase you to raise a complaint to get my money refunded too me, as the shop had told me they hadn't taken the money, I have then had to wait a week to get you to agree to refund my money, another few days til its refunded on my card... And not even an offer of a gesture of goodwill....disgusting customer service|Useful|Share",13-Nov-21

Lianne C,"Waited 70 minutes for order from Leyton delivery store and when it arrived 2 of the pizzas were missing large areas of cheese and the garlic bread was burnt. The manager said they would replace them but 2.5 hours later only part of the order arrived and one of the pizza's still had parts missing cheese. When I called back the manager refused to send the rest of the order and put the phone down. They then did this 6 times. I never received the rest of my order, yet paid full price and had to place a complaint to customer service. After the behaviour of the manager I would genuinely concerned about eating there as I would be scared that they would do something to it. Disgraceful service and management don't take responsibility for when things go wrong. This is the second time I have had to make a complaint about the quality of their food.

Didn’t arrive until 10 mins  later. No apology whatsoever for the 35 minute wait for 2 puddings. During this period, kitchen staff were talking to waiting staff and ignored our orders. Apologies were given and accepted but appalling service I’m afraid. Was told there were new staff in kitchen but management need to manage this. I asked for paper receipts as email receipts were not received at time of leaving.

Gary Hemlock,"Where do I start...1. The restaurant was empty when we entered, we sat down to find a label on the table stating that orders had to be done on your mobile, this was not explained at the door (very poor), I never done any transactions over my phone before so got up to leave, at which point the waiter stated that he could take the order (why was this only explained after we got up to leave).    2. My daughter does not understand the buffet concept, and demanded a pizza from the menu, so landed up paying double the price for a pizza at nearly £18, double what I would have paid for the buffet, for less food (no pasta, no eat as much as u like, no salad).3. Having to pay before we receive the meal, this is the first time that I have been into a restaurant and paid for my meal before the meal. All restaurants I have been in charge after you have received the meal, and this is the first time I have been in pizza hut and had this done to me, when I challenged the waiter on this he said that it was company policy.  It is obvious that you have very little respect or trust for your customers just contempt. 4. Bearing in mind that the restaurant was empty, 40 minutes later the daughters pizza still had not arrived called the waiter over to ask what was the delay, considering the place was empty when we arrived, to which he responded that there had been a error in the kitchen, and they had placed my daughters pizza on the buffet counter, several issues with this statement...   a.  Why did they not inform us of the delay, why          wait for me to ask.   b.  If I had not asked I probably would not have         received the pizza and         left without receiving the product that I had         paid for    c. I also think his explanation difficult to believe as        the daughters pizza was large sharing pizza,        which comes on different plate to that which        they place on the buffet, and quite possibly her        pizza was a different size also.5. When my daughters pizza arrive she ordered a plain cheese and tomato pizza, she found several kernals of sweetcorn on her pizza, which I had to remove.6. my daughter likes to select and pour the pepsi herself when she came back to the table you could nearly see through the drink, obvious to me that there was something wrong with either the syrup u used or the dispensing unit, i went up tried the same flavour same thing happened, tried different flavour this was OK, why was there not a sign there explaining the issue.7. Buffet includes a selection of salad and pasta, where the salad offering was acceptable, I was in the restaurant for nearly 90 minutes and NO pasta was offered on the buffet counter, this is unacceptable and false advertising.  If there was NO pasta available this should have been explained at the door or on the sheet of paper handed to every customer on the door.8. Please don't blame staff shortages for these issues for the first 20 to 25 minutes there were more staff than customers.9. Me and my daughter have frequented Pizza hut for sit down and takeaway meals several times a year, but for the past 18 months we both have been shielding (government advise) as both of us have medical conditions that makes vulnerable to covid, and this was the first dinning out experience since February 2020, and if this experience is anything to go by, we will NOT be going for Pizza Hut again.|Useful|Share",23-Aug-21

I made an order 2 days ago and had am email 10 minutes later to say my order has not gone threw and something went wrong but they took 30 pounds out of my account?! I call the hut to rre order from and they wouldn't make the food for me nor help me and said its not their problem and to contact customer service...but you can't even call customer service it just redirects you to email which takes up to 5 working days to reply!! I sent them an email 2 days ago and still no response nor have I received my money!!

TK,"Oh, what a shame, what started as a lovely gesture by my employers as appreciation for the work I had done for them, where I was offered some vouchers of my choice, this turned out to be a total embarrassment and left me feeling un-appreciated by Pizza Hut.So came the day to use my voucher and I checked online to see what they have, no problem nice meal deal with an extra side, drink, and dips. Came to a penny short of the voucher so I though great, that will do. It says you can’t use online, so no problem, got the car out and went to our local Pizza Hut.That’s where it all started going wrong, I was treated as an idiot “as though I should know” the web site I looked at was for the Pizza delivery service (although it did not say that on the select and collect section) and I had gone to the Pizza Restaurant take away service, the implication was “are you stupid or something, don’t you know anything” so we drove to the Pizza delivery service to be told they don’t take vouchers they have to be used at Restaurants. So back to the Restaurant.Not able to get the meal deal from the website I opted for their Treat yourself deal, only to be told sorry we don’t have the included toppings, but we can put on ham, bacon and chicken.No problem I will go with that, then came the bill to pay and instead of £13.49 for the Treat yourself deal they charged me £15.19 because of the difference in cost of the toppings. Not the end of the world I know, but I thought flipping cheek.Not a good experience of my first use of this Pizza outlet, to be fair the Pizza was very nice (better than some I’ve had) but wouldn’t use them again unless their customer service gets better or at least their staff show some empathy to people including new customers.|Useful|Share",6-Aug-21

Sonny,"Bought two large pizzas from Pizza Hut takeaway latein the evening and by the time I arrived home Irealised there was hardly any cheese on both pizzas.Both pizzas looked like they had been prepared in a rushwithout proper care or attention.When I tried calling back no one answered.The next day a staff member called Vicky was rude,abrupt and not prepared to listen to my complaint.We had to add our own cheese to both pizzas dueto the lack of it.Cheese is a basic ingredient on pizza and this particularPizza Hut on Meadfield Road, Langley, Slough hardly putany cheese on.I asked whether they had new staff making the pizzato which Vicky gave no reply.He began making assumptions about my complaint andbecame argumentative even though I spoke calmly.It was clear Vicky did not care about me as a customer.He hung up, didn't listen to everything I was sayingand lacked professionalism and basic people skills.I've been a regular customer at this particular Pizza Hutand even informed Vicky about this but he simply doesnot care!I've never been treated so badly by Pizza Hut.It's appalling that your large organisationwould treat customers so poorly.Vicky works for Pizza Hut, he is a representative ofyour business and treats customers like dirt!I shall not return to Pizza Hut and have commenced writingmy reviews where you shall receive low ratings everywhere.The behaviour presented by Vicky is not acceptable andI don't think he even understands what he is doing wrong.My complaint should be investigated and an explanation providedfor all points raised.Vicky's approach to the customer shows he does not careand has no regard for the customer.Whoever was making and preparing the pizzas showed poorskill and possibly no experience.I expect your company to apologise to me, show empathy and some customer care skills on how to put things right.Paying customers are not garbage but Vicky thinks different.Like I said, I won't be returning to Pizza Hut afterthis experience.Yours trulyMr Bains|Useful|Share",2-Aug-21
Ron Burgess,"We (my granddaughter) ordered a delivery of pizzas via the app and other items for delivery on Wed 4th Aug 2021, which included a gluten free pizza. You took the money but called after a while to say you didn't have any gluten free pizzas. So we cancelled the order. I asked for a refund. I was told you couldn't and it was up to me to call and get it sorted via a customer help line. With a number available on line. Then after listening to the automated message which then said you had to do it via online web email. After finally connecting to a page (some were giving page not found) I had to fill a form in with my life history. Then I get an email it will take another 5 days before it even gets seen. This is totally unacceptable service. First you take money instantly for items you don't have then I have to spend ages applying to get my own money back. DON’T use Covid as an excuse. Every other responsible business can issue refunds instantly or has staff working in secure locations (isolated) for customer service.After messaging via your Facebook page (Ethan) I get contacted by Richard from Pizza hut support Aug 6 (request 278961) requesting a copy of the order which I supplied (order 6919955427) Crewe. I was told he would contact me and “advise further” It is now 1 week since the order no refund, no further contact.This is unacceptable, Relevant Information has been supplied multiple times!!!! Is it a war of attrition to see if I give up? (I won’t)Why wasn’t the order simply refunded by Crewe when I rang, He said “ We Can’t” was he lying?Why is there such a problem?Why, 1 week later (Wed Aug 11) and after several messages, emails etc, do I still have to spend so much time trying to get our money back for goods not supplied?More messages from Ethan 11 Aug  (Facebook messenger) I am still getting the run-around from you. Requesting information I have already given- vis:- copy of the email. Amazingly after saying you haven’t had any response from Crewe and me saying I am escalating it they have suddenly got in touch even though you say you can’t call them. Your comment about only using electronic communication. Do you realise you can’t catch the virus over the phone? And also now you are only attempting to refund for one item (GF Pizza) not the whole bill. THE WHOLE ORDER WAS CANCELLED as previously stated several times. An email was sent to you with the original order email in as well over an hour before your most recent request. You know all the details (account, email, order) already because you have used my granddaughters name which I never supplied via the Facebook messenger chat.Another message Aug 11 17:30  :  my “refund request” has been passed to refunds team, and yet another 5 days to wait . Another message (Siobhan) Aug 13th 11:50 your refund has been processed, allow 3-5 working days again- FUMING!|Useful|Share",2-Aug-21

Salad bar was a bit disappointing, no pasta options, struggled to find a clean bowl and one member of our party found a hair in the potato salad 😞. Friendly male server when pizza arrived but it all went down hill when we finished our pizza and I asked the female server for our dessert, I was told in quite a sullen fashion that it would be 5 to 10 minutes. After about 25 minutes I asked when our dessert would be ready to be told quite abruptly that it was just coming. Our re-heated brownie and ice-cream arrived but unfortunately the brownie was burnt, so not worth the wait. On leaving the restaurant another server asked the guests just leaving if they had a nice time, our female server just gave me 'a look' on leaving. She obviously knew we were unhappy. I'm not sure we would bother going in and sitting down again. Previously used the takeaway service there which was exceptional.|Useful|Share",Updated 1 Aug 2021

I ordered from them 2/3 days ago and upon arrival, the food was so cold that the cheese on the garlic bread had become a congealed mound and the pizza was so oily, the bottom of the pizza box was soaked, the pizza base was wet and the pizza just tasted of pure grease. I immediately called the manager of the Surrey Quays Pizza Hut who told me that he wouldn't refund me and if I wanted a refund, I would have to contact customer services. As I asked for the customer services number, he slammed the phone down on me. I called back and asked again and he told me I 'can find it on the internet'. I called the Pizza Hut customer service number to find they have disabled their phone lines due to Covid and have had to email them. Despite telling them I want a refund and will never order from them again, Pizza Hut's 'resolution' thus far is to offer me a money off voucher! They must be joking! It's a pure insult - they're willing to take your cash but then want you to spend more money with them and chance it so you can use your voucher.

I tried to get the attention of the host, however as we were at the back no one could see us. Our meal came and I had said my drink was wrong (15 mins after receiving this) to which I was told that's what I ordered, I confirmed it shows on my order on the App it was a mixed fruit. The girl then said she needed to go get the tray to take my drink back, after 5 minutes she returned and advised there was no mixed fruits? (therefore it wasn't a mistake and it was on purpose they gave me the wrong one.) With no alternative I had to keep this.We then asked for sauce which we received, however this was a small amount and no salt on the table, no one came back to check on us and make sure our food was okay. As we were at the back we couldn't get anyone attention for sauce or salt. We then finished out food and left, the table wasn't cleaned, we weren't offered more drinks, no deserts. I understand this is COVID etc, however the host should still be making sure all our meals were okay. There was 4 of us at the table and we all spent £67 in total.

I and my family have been customers of Pizza Hut for decades!!!!  And To Be Honest, to My Surprise the delivery service that We have gotten the last few times has bee….a bit upsetting. But We never ever complain. But After how bad the last time was, that We never said a word about, yet honestly should have….When We relieved such a repeatedly bad delivery again, that this time I called. And to This Ild Mama/Nana’s Horror…This is The Unimaginable Response that We got and Left My Sweet Little Grandkids in Tears. I called The location that We ordered Our Pizza from. I nicely asked, Why did They not knock or ring the bell when they left the pizza on our cold rainy porch? Instantly the person said “hey wait while I get The manager”. It was soon clear that they thought they had put me on hold. Because the female manager said “keep them on hold awhile, what do they expect, it’s not our job to ring the doorbell.” After awhile a girl, who was instantly hostile, asked what my problem was? I explained that I was told to expect the pizza by 6:40. Yet the app said that it was out for delivery at 6:20. So My Grandkids & I sat at the dining room table laughing and waiting. But no knock no doorbell. So at 6:40 I went to the door and found the pizza in the cold rain. I asked Her why didn’t they knock or ring the bell since I couldn’t know when in those 20 minutes it would arrive. She yelled at Me, on speakerphone where My little grandkids heard, “don’t You use profanity at Me!!!” All I asked was why did they not ring my bell when they left the pizza on my front porch? No profanity thank You!!!! In front of My We ones Especially!!!!! She hung up on Me!!!! I tried to call back to clear things up!!! But they hung up on Me without even answering for 24 times😱. Who does that???? What professional business does that???? I just wanted an answer 😢. I swear that is all!!!! I’m 59 years old. I’m a good woman who always treats others with kindness and respect. My Precious Grandkids Wouldn’t even eat the pizza if I heated it up. They were so shocked to hear Their Nana treated in this way!!! I do not want a free pizza.. I want, deserve for this woman to be properly disciplined and I deserve a proper apology. That is all I want. She must not be allowed to represent Your business in this way. To be so rude, disrespectful and unprofessional from the very first moment and to accuse Me of saying something I never ever say!!!! Instead of facing the problem, is beyond not ok. How unprofessional!!!!! To no longer even except the call!!!! I didn’t treat Her or the business badly. There is absolutely no excuse for the delivery service or most of all Her treatment of Me!!!!! Please I’m asking You to not let this woman represent Your Company in this horrific way. It would make all the difference in the world to me and my large family to hear back from You with real results!!!! It’s just a pizza….yet We are deeply hurt 😔.

Leon,Worst experience ever . Ordered my pizza online and paid for online . Gets a phone call from the pizza place telling me the oven has gone off and that they can’t fulfil my order . I said can you pass it on to some other Pizza Hut store . They said no . So I asked what about my money she said oh we can’t give it you back you will have to ring customer services and request it back . I was utterly gobsmacked . That was last Sunday night so I couldn’t ring customer services then and then next day was bank holiday Monday so neither could a ring them them . So there I was with no pizza and out of pocket £20 . I got intouch with customer service on the Tuesday and to and throwing they had to ask the store to confirm it before they could refund me . Like why ? They said they would refund it me back anyway I’m still waiting for it .

Little, if any of the delivery fee goes to the delivery drivers, which leaves me to wonder if it's an unwarranted usury tax!  Food delivery drivers bust their behinds to get our food to us on time, so I ask you, why are the corporations cashing in on their hard labor?It's about time people start complaining about the delivery fees being surreptitiously charged to them!

It’s a shame that no one owns the responsibility about punctuality, bad food. Pizza Huts customer services is non existent.

Victoria Owens,"I would have given it 1 star if it wasnt for the lovely lad on the phone and the second driver: My mum and I had ordered pizza hut delivery (UK). With contactless delivery, we were made to pay online initially before we could get our food (which was perfectly fine with us). The tracker was then emailed to state that the delivery would be made at 21:10-21:20 which we thought ""40 minute wait is fine by us"". So we waited...and waited...and continued to wait until 21:28. Now it got to the point where, whilst overall being late doesnt necessarily bother us (our area is a maze) we can see ALL cars entering where our house is and NONE had turned up...I then proceeded to receive a text stating the food had been delivered. this is not the case. I phoned up our local store (where the food was coming from) and spoke to a lovely lad who was kind, who offered to call the driver, who then proceed to lie to this lad and say he ""had delivered the food to [my address]""....""no sir, he didnt, our house has views from the sitting-room to the entrances of the street and NO cars have been here at all."" The poor lad then says ""Right ok...give me a moment""...my mum at this point had stood at the door for about 40 minutes wondering when this pizza delivery would arrive and said ""We can do a video and prove we have no boxes if he would like"".....the lad came back and said he would arrange for the order to be sent out ASAP. The second driver arrived within 30 minutes of us phoning and he was lovely even shutting our front door for us.Overall, if we could have paid in cash, this situation wouldn't have bothered us as much as it had. However, I would like to suggest that in future, for continued use of contactless delivery - the drivers should ask the home owner for the order number before handing over the goods. This way, when customers pay online you will not come across a he-said-she-said situation. Just a thought.|Useful|Share",4-May-21

I have been trying to ascertain if the meat/poultry in their UK product range had been subject of Religious Slaughter Methods (compliant with either Kosher or Halal).  I first contacted them on 8 Jan 2021 and even though they replied I never received an answer nor do I believe I would.  I was told on multiple occasions they were contacting their so called 'Team' and they would get back to me but each time they didn't.  I prompted them for reply after reply but still the same old ""We have received your email and have passed your queries on to the relevant team.  Once we have received a response from our internal team we will be in touch. "".  It is now 20 April 2021 nearly 4 months and still no reply so you really do have to question their Customer Service but more importantly why have they failed to reply in the first place.  I even gave them an option to advise me not to purchase their Meat products if they could not offer any assurances but even that was too difficult for them.Good luck with attempting to get a response to any enquiry because based on my experience you will be waiting a very long time if they can actually be bothered to do so.|Useful|Share",9-Apr-21

They cut the pizzas in such a way that one slice was about 1/4 of the entire pizza while other slices were about the size of a half dollar. NOT kidding. Took pictures. We live about 1.5 miles from the store but the delivery time after the app stated it was on its way was 32 minutes and by the time we received the mess, it was not hot and the cheese was stuck to the top of the box lid on the pizza with the extra pound or so of raw dough added.|Useful|Share",24-Mar-21

Stephen Andrew Archer,"So not too ling ago, my family ordered a couple pizzas online, pre-paid so it would be quicker to pick them up.  The website said it would take about 20 minutes, and they would be ready to pick up.So I went out to pick up my order from the pizza hut off of highway 291 in Independence Mo. I got there about 10 minutes early, so I wasn't expecting them to have my food ready yet. Entering the store, there didn't seem to be anybody there. Shortly after, a lady came in and got in line behind me. After about 5 minutes of waiting, I decided to sit on the bench they had inside, and right after, an employee finally showed up and started helping the lady who came in after me. I get in line behind her, figuring that it didn't really matter which of us got served first. She got her food, and before I could even address the employee, he disappeared into the back again without even acknowledging my existence.This time, I stayed right there at the counter waiting for them to come back, and a group of two more people came in behind me. After I had waited a total of around 30 minutes (10 minutes for the other folks in line), the employee came back and asked ""how can I help you?"" however, when I started to speak, he cut me off saying ""no, I was talking to that person.""  He then proceeded to help the other folks in line, all while acting like I wasn't even there!So after he had helped a total of three more people, ignoring a question from one of them regarding why he's not letting me get the food I already paid for, and me waiting a total of one full hour, he disappeared into the back again!At this point, my patience had run out, and I was in the middle of figuring out how many 2-liters would it take to get my $30 worth when that employee came back and FINALLY decided to actually a knowledge that I was even there!  And of course, the pizzas were all both cold and with the wrong toppings.I can honestly say, after that, my family and I will never be ordering from Pizza Hut ever again.|Useful|Share",14-Mar-21

After waiting an hour and a half (when the wait time was estimated to be 50 min) I finally decided to call and check on my order. After being in hold for 20 min I called back and got a human being. I told him what was going on and he placed me on hold after I asked him not to. On hold for another 20 min so I decide to get in my car and drive to the location (Orem, University Pkwy). I get there and there is one young kid working. I explained who I was and showed him that I was still on hold and he chuckled. He said sorry I'm the only one here. Keep in mind this place was dead. No other customers, no ringing phones. I told him I wanted the store manager and he said he wasn't available until tomorrow. I told him I wasn't leaving until he called his manager. He cussed and me and said he doesn't get paid enough for this. He said he'll make my food... Now that's it's been more than 2 hours.. I told him no, I wanted my order cancelled. He again tried making food. I said I didn't want the food, I wanted my order cancelled. He finally agreed to call his manager (Spencer). He agreed to come to the location and talk to me. It's now 905 and the manager showed up. He was helpful and listened to my concerns. His system showed that my $55 order was delivered (which is obviously wasn't or I would not be going thru this). His guess was that it got delivered to the wrong address. Interesting that their tracking system never updated and you're literally unable to reach anyone to speak with. I'm beyond frustrated. I'm a little more calm now that I've spoken to the manager but this was seriously the worst food service interaction of my life. I was issued a credit but after that is used I will NEVER use Pizza Hut again. Especially this location. Absolutely zero customer service and the young employee didn't give a @$+* about anything.

When I went back to look at the menu there is nowhere that it is stated what pasta type will be used. In addition to this the food was pretty ordinary and very expensive.Re: Pizza Hut, my advice is to rethink their pasta dishes.

Chris Prevost,"Normally I don’t leave a review for anyone. We are all working hard to make it. Last night my wife ordered 2 pizzas online for $30 @ 5:00pm coming from Portland, TN store. 5:45 scheduled delivery based on the site. That time passed and my pregnant wife began to get irritated and hungry. When we called to cancel we were told it’s on its way @ 6:00. Then I noticed it’s 6:30 and no pizza, when I called i was told there’s a 2hr difference in the online time vs the store time. Now why hasn’t upper management recognized this flaw in the algorithm and fix it before you lose more customers. Simple logistics. But what irritates me is the driver knew he was late, I stood in my living room window with the lights off inside and watched him sit it on the porch and walk off. No knock on the door, I couldn’t of been seen I made sure of that, then I went and picked up the COLD pizza the driver knew he delivered a rate. Poor upper management, and it’s spreading downhill.|Useful|Share",6-Dec-20

Donna FT,"I like pizza hut. I have frequented 'The hut' many times but have stopped doing so as the salad bar has replaced cous cous with tortilla chips. I have digressed, being partial to a chicken strip now and again I order both those and a pizza from Cambridge Heath Road. Each time I state on the notes: No garlic sprinkles. Garlic sprinkles are always there regardless. I've seen the can they come in, it is a huge hair lacquer type can which is sprayed with gusto by staff giving the pizza a healthy slick of shine  a bizarre taste and shining green particles akin to glitter everywhere. You can't just shake them off, oh no, they are stuck quick. The last pizza I ordered I specified: Please do not put garlic sprinkles on my pizza. I am allergic to them and will die on consumption. Pizza arrived, opened the box and ofcourse sprinkles were there. Please get rid of the sprinkles. They are no use to man nor beast.|Useful|Share",30-Nov-20

Also £13.99 for three starters which was supposed to be a special offer but, when two of these were portions of soggy oven chips, it wasn’t much of a bargain. One medium glass of wine £5.29 when my local hotel charges £5.00 for a large glass. Potato salad was dry on top as if it had been standing out for ages.

Manny,"If I could give minus stars I would. Pizza Hut customer service? They should be investigated for even suggesting the name. Went to Pizza Hut junction 9 retail park Warrington in between both lockdowns a day prior to 2nd lockdown. Went with family and spent a lot of money and stayed a while. Didn’t realise the time and overstayed on the car park by 26 minutes, was sent a parking charge notice. I contacted Pizza Hut, as I am aware that the business on the sites can have parking charges overturned for customers. Pizza Hut customer services got back to me and said that the reason I’d got a parking charge was because I’d overstayed on the car park which was for Pizza Hut customers? Errrrrr yes I know that as I was a customer and showed them my proof of purchase. They said the car park is owned by the parking company, it’s not owned by them they manage it, and Pizza Hut could not do anything and I would need to pay. So I was their customer there was hardly no customers there whilst we were there so you’d think they’d appreciate the customers, but no. You have lockdown, furlough, money is beyond tight, you have Christmas so close, people with low mood, But as long as Pizza Hut get their money they aren’t interested in the customer. So it looks like there will be a lot less to spend on Christmas this year, all because Pizza Hut customer services can’t be bothered making a simple call to the car park company. And another point is the delay in their responses, you send an email and they say they will get back to you in 48 hours? I think their 48 hours must be a different 24 hours that we work to. As it’s been well over time and no response Funniest thing was at the end of the email they said ‘we hope you enjoyed your experience’ hmmmmm let me think what a great experience and service I had If Pizza Hut read this there’s still time for you to help me out.|Useful|Share",29-Oct-20

Anthony Jones,"The Pizza Hut in Greenville, PA 16125. I ordered a pizza and hit contactless delivery... I was told I did any... Because I have never done that. The pizzaman comes to my house and knocked twice. By the time I got from my couch to the door, 10 steps away, and opened the door he was already in his car. I opened the door and the driver yelled to confirm the address. I confirmed and went to grab his tip. I came back... Maybe 8 seconds I stepped away...The driver was pulling off. At this point, I had no idea he sat the food on the porch. It was not in plain sight at all, but like off to the side, literally by my bushes. I called Pizza Hut and said hey the driver left with the food. The guy on the phone said he has to wait until the driver comes back. A few minutes later Pizza Hut calls back and I miss the call. As I'm sitting on the couch it dawns on me the pizza might be on the porch and let me check before I flip out. I go back to the porch as sure enough over in the corner by my bushes is the pizza. I'm like, what the F, this has been sitting here for at least 15-20 mins... I bring the pizza in and check it...it appears still good.  Bite into a slice and it's doughy... It's like not cook entirety. Call Pizza Hut back and tell them I got my pizza, it was left on the porch... But it's not cooked, could I have a replacement. ”Guy says nothing is wrong with our ovens and we have not had any other complaints call the 1-800 number.” Again I'm like, what the F, ...I didn't even know Pizza Hut had a 1-800 number. So cool, I google the number and leave a complaint. This was all on Saturday. They call me back today and pretty much try to explain to me that the pizza was not undercooked, it was soggy from the veggies sitting on it. First off, she was talking like she had a slice of the pizza, the second I know the difference between undercooked and soggy, and third I have ordered the same pizza from them a few times before! It was cooked through and I never had a soggy pizza from them. This time the entire experience was bad. Then the manager offered me a coupon! Thanks but no thanks, I don't want a damn coupon I want my money back because the customer service I received was awful. She made an excuse for everything that was wrong and for the parts she had no excuses she blamed on me. I'm thinking like why are you being so defensive over this pizza...this could have been resolved that same day by throwing another pizza in the oven... But instead, here we are!  I'm never eating there again so I have ZERO reasons to accept a coupon... And at this point, I do not trust that they will not do something to my pizza before I get it... I'm done with Pizza Hut in general... DiGiorno from here on out!|Useful|Share",26-Sep-20

They also still had the cheek to charge for these even though they weren’t received. After calling back, they said they would bring the chicken wings within 15 minute and that we ‘should feel lucky’ that we got them. So saying that they’d ‘ran out’ was a complete lie.

If you are an active listener like myself and worked in customer service over 22 years -you could even hear her smile the entire time. Not to mention we changed our order 3 times. Still she remained herself and it shows she is not just an employee of Pizza Hut but A BLESSING to the originization as she sets a good name for the face of the business.

Lori Santistevan,The northern store in Pueblo has a rude so called manager named Peter. I sympathize if you ever have to deal with a wrong order and him. He is quick to hang up and slow to rectify a wrong order. I will NEVER order from this location again.|Useful|Share,Updated 15 Sept 2020

Jude Ritchie,"19 Sep 2020, 23:25 BST I paced order online waited over 1 hour for delivery, only half of the order came and wrong pizzas, rang branch 2 times spoke to Manager (Becky) who was very abrupt and basically accused me of trying to cheat them. Eventually agreed to send correct order, and I should send back wrong pizza. I waited another hour and then rang back branch to be told the Manager said she will not be re doing my order, and I must reclaim my money online. The Manager name was Becky and I also spoke to Sabrina, both were extremely rude and unhelpful and did not represent the organisation in a courteous or professional manner.I was so disgusted with the staff and organisation, I asked for a refund of £46 as advised.I never received my order. They offered 2 × £20 vouchers as a goodwill gesture. I asked when would I be in receipt if my refund and was then informed to my surprise that the vouchers were my refund, which did not even cover my expenditure.Both the Kennington branch staff and customer service personnel (Anne C) do not operate with any professionalism. I am still awaiting my refund.|Useful|Share",11-Sep-20
Cam Akn,"Your tv commercial indicates no delivery fee for a large pizza, for a total of $10.50I looked at the website, provided in the commercial, but was unable to not pay a delivery fee with your special. I then called the local Pizza Hut and they had no clue about free delivery and said delivery would be $4It’s been awful dealing with a President who is manipulative and lying. Pizza Hut too? Lost my business, not to mention I’ll be sharing with others next week about your crooked business tactic.|Useful|Share",9-Sep-20

Khaled WASSEF,"Visited Pizza Hut Park Royal today and decided will never set foot in any Pizza Hut ever again. Were greeted by a rude person who, instead of asking us how many people we were, told the first person who went in ""hey! You should come talk to me first!"" Then she sat us at a table that was supposedly cleaned up after the previous service. But the table was filthy and sticky.. and I had ketchup stains on my shirt! Despite making us pick up our own cutlery and order online to avoid human contact, this restaurant is not adhering to the most basic hygiene requirements! Worse thing is that when I told the waiter that table was dirty, he replied: ""you waited till we put the food to say that the table was dirty?!"" Never again!|Useful|Share",2-Sep-20
Dawna Marie,"If I could give 0 stars, that would be best. To place an order through the call center is an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE. We had accidentally placed an order online before we were done with our full order and tried calling the store directly that we were to pick up from. Tried for 10 minutes to get through to the store with no luck. We kept getting directed to the call center everytime. All we needed was for them to confirm what had already been ordered and to add 2 more things to our original order. We kept getting transferred from person to person, and in the 10 minutes we were on the phone, the only thing they helped us with was what location we ordered from (which we already knew). Absolutely terrible customer service. They were of no help at all. Ended up having to drive directly to the store to solve the problem and then wait another additional 10-15 minutes for our added items, which we could have done at home had the call center been able to do a simple task!!!!!!!! Never again. No issues with the ACTUAL pizza hut location, just the call center. They are useless.|Useful|Share",2-Sep-20

Christine Neff,"Pizza Hut is losing it's appeal.Pizza Hut used to represent Quality Food at a decent price. Pizza Hut has made so many cut backs that they now become the worst pizza. They have also taken away many customer favorites such as Taco Pizza, St. Louis Style Pizza The Priazzo, Their Pizones & their Sandwiches. Not to mention the change in their Crusts (especially the Pan Pizza crust), the lack of Cheese & other toppings. Pizza Hut has become a disgrace to it's original quality. Everything that used to make Pizza Hut Great & the Most desired Pizza is Gone Gone Gone !!! Wake Up Pizza Hut !!!!!!|Useful|Share",2-Sep-20
Vereen,"Bought 3 large pizzas at pizza hut in st.  Paul ne.  They were so bad after 10 adults left 1 1/2 pizzas cause we could not eat them.  I spent $55 on them.  I had to throw them away.
